##Welcome to Bầu Cua Tôm Cá (Gourd Crab Shrimp Fish)!

Bầu Cua Tôm Cá (Gourd Crab Shrimp Fish) is a traditional Vietnamese game where players can bet on
6 different items (Fish, Shrimp, Crab, Rooster, Bottle Gourd, and Deer).
Three dice where each face of the dice has a picture of the item that a player can 
bet on are rolled at each round. If 1 of the die matches a bet, then the player receives their original 
bet and loses no money. If 2 of the dice matches a bet, the player receives twice 
their original bet. If 3 matches, then they win 3 times the bet. If none of the dice
matches, then the player loses their bet. For more information on the rules of the game, visit

In this version of the game, each player starts out with $100 and during each round, player can place a bet on 
only 1 item. The last player to lose all their money wins that game.
